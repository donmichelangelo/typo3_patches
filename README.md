# TYPO3 Post Community Patches
This project aims to collect and to provide at first place security patches (CVE) of TYPO3 versions where the official support has ended.
However, you may also find here non-security patches that may fix certain bugs.

Although some of these post-patches were directly published by the TYPO3 developer team, other patches might come from community members and the functionality, quality or security impact couldn't be tested in every aspect.

These patches are distributed in the hope that they will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY!
